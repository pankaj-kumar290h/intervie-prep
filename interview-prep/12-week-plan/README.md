4. **Weekend:** Deep dive sessions
5. **Commute:** Listen to coding podcasts or review notes
6. **Use Spaced Repetition:** Review previous topics weekly

## Adjustments

- **If ahead of schedule:** Add more Hard problems, study advanced system design
- **If behind:** Focus on patterns over individual problems, prioritize Medium difficulty
- **If struggling:** Slow down, master fundamentals before moving forward

**Remember:** Consistency beats intensity. Better to do 1 hour daily than 7 hours once a week!
