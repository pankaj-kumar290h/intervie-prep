---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Perform well in coding interviews
- Explain solutions clearly
- Review all DSA patterns
- Understand authentication and security

---

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1: Mock Interview #1 (2 hours)
**Mock Interview (1.5 hours):**
- Use Pramp, InterviewBit, or find a peer
- Solve 1-2 Medium LeetCode problems
- Focus on:
  - Explaining your thought process
  - Communicating clearly
  - Time management

**Review (30 min):**
- Review your performance
- Identify areas for improvement
- Note what went well

### Day 2: Pattern Review (2 hours)
**Review (2 hours):**
- Review all patterns from [Coding Patterns Cheatsheet](../../coding/patterns/patterns-cheatsheet.md):
  - Two Pointers
  - Sliding Window
  - Binary Search
  - BFS/DFS
  - Backtracking
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Heaps
- Create a quick reference sheet

### Day 3: Mock Interview #2 (2 hours)
**Mock Interview (1.5 hours):**
- Another mock interview
- Try different problem types
- Practice explaining edge cases

**Review (30 min):**
- Compare with first mock interview
- Track improvement

### Day 4: Weak Areas Review (2 hours)
**Review (2 hours):**
- Identify your weak areas from previous weeks
- Review those topics:
  - Re-read study materials
  - Re-solve problems you struggled with
  - Practice explaining solutions

### Day 5: Authentication & Security (1 hour)
**Study (1 hour):**
- Read [Backend Advanced: Authentication](../../coding/questions/backend-advanced-questions.md#authentication--security)
- Understand:
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  - OAuth 2.0 basics
  - Session vs Token authentication
  - Password hashing
- Practice examples:
  ```javascript
  // JWT structure
  // Header.Payload.Signature
  
  // OAuth flow
  // 1. User authorizes
  // 2. Get authorization code
  // 3. Exchange for access token
  // 4. Use access token for API calls
  ```

### Day 6: Mock Interview #3 (2 hours)
**Mock Interview (1.5 hours):**
- Final mock interview before week 12
- Try to simulate real interview conditions:
  - Time limit
  - No hints
  - Explain as you code

**Review (30 min):**
- Final review of performance
- Note remaining weak areas

### Day 7: Comprehensive Review (2 hours)
**Review (2 hours):**
- Review all DSA topics:
  - Arrays, Hash Tables
  - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees, Graphs
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Backtracking
  - Heaps, Tries
- Solve 2-3 problems from each category
- Practice explaining solutions out loud

## Mock Interview Tips

### Before the Interview
- **Prepare:** Review common patterns
- **Rest:** Get good sleep
- **Set up:** Test your environment

### During the Interview
- **Clarify:** Ask questions about requirements
- **Think out loud:** Explain your thought process
- **Start simple:** Brute force first, then optimize
- **Test:** Walk through examples
- **Handle mistakes:** It's okay to correct yourself

### After the Interview
- **Reflect:** What went well? What didn't?
- **Review:** Look at optimal solutions
- **Practice:** Focus on weak areas
